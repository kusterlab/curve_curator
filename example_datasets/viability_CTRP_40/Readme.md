# Viability_CTRP 
The data is from the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.003 .

This is only the 40uM drugs subset. 
Please keep in mind that CurveCurator can only deal with the same drug range. 
That is why there are so many individual runs split by the drug range on zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/8399823).
