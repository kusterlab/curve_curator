# Example batch file:
# Each line should be a valid absolute or relative path to a toml file.
# The script will process each dataset based on the toml file one after the other. 
# Make sure that you work in multiple different folders. Otherwise CurveCurator will overwrite outputs.
# Comments are possible since v0.6.
